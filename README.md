# sleep-tracker
A sleep tracker application using Ionic.

This mobile application allows the user to log overnight sleep - the duration, start and end times, and quality of sleep, to log sleepiness throughout the day, to view previously logged overnight sleep and daytime sleepiness data. The application stores logged data locally so the user's data is preserved.
